#### June 2 2015

## Overview

#### Motivation

- What do I want to say with this page? What's its purpose?
	Page to show employers. toss it on resume next to email. Also to show parents and future iXers for commission
- Is this a professional page, a portfolio? Just for fun, a design playground?
	Mostly a professional page, add easter eggs. Maybe text-based games or something.

#### Content

- What do I want to actually put on it? Suggestions:
- Links to things you've made (photos, videos, class projects)
	Github page potentially. Link to projects. Letters of recommendation (hue). Downloadable rtf resume.
-
	text-based game or something. Easter eggs. 
	Competitions stuff. Pics of stuff that can't go on resume (APT puzzle tourney etc.)
- A self intro, with links to how to contact you (FB, Github, etc.)
	Contact info yes. linkedIn why not and emails and stuff
	Ways to set up meetings
- Be as specific as you can here

## Design

- What's the look and feel of it? Minimalist? Intricate? Goth?
	minimal text, but flashy (high contrast pictures and stuff)
- You'll do a lot more of this when we start thinking about CSS.
- Will you use images? Icons? From where?
	Images from fbo
- Do some research! Look at other sites for inspiration.

## Code

You'll be using HTML and CSS, but as you think about your layout,
you might want to start thinking about logical sections of the page
(header, footer, sidebarâ€”if you want any of these things),
and how you might structure those with HTML.

	Picture of me, cool background. No scrolling to find stuff.
